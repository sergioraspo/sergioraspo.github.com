## some basics issues


```{r}

library(tidyr)

library(ggplot2)

str(airquality) 

dim(airquality)

head(airquality)

str(diamonds)

head(diamonds)

```

## Scatterplot


```{r}

ggplot(data = diamonds)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))

```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
